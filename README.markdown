**Instructor: Jos√© Mota**

One of the most common and essential scenarios for a business is commerce. Online shops fill the Internet as a means of providing value to customers. If
you are looking to implement a shop yourself you're in the right place.

Learn how to create a Rails application that shows your products off, allows customers to select them for purchase, add to a shopping cart and also place orders so goods are delivered to them. We'll focus on data model design and on integrating Rails with Braintree to process financial transactions.
